It's also consistent with HashiCorp's other open-source projects."
"circonus-gometrics","https://github.com/hashicorp/circonus-gometrics","MPL-2.0","
Reason: Given that this is a HashiCorp repository and a metrics client library, MPL-2.0 is the most suitable choice. The Mozilla Public License 2.0 provides a good balance between open source collaboration and protecting modifications, which aligns with HashiCorp's typical licensing strategy. MPL-2.0's file-level copyleft ensures modifications to existing files remain open while allowing proprietary components to be built alongside it, making it ideal for a metrics library that other projects may want to integrate and modify."
"cli","https://github.com/hashicorp/cli","MPL-2.0","

Reason: For a CLI library from HashiCorp, MPL-2.0 provides a balanced approach that encourages community engagement while maintaining some commercial protections. The file-level copyleft nature of MPL-2.0 allows users to freely use and modify the library while ensuring modifications to existing files remain open source, but doesn't restrict linking or usage in larger proprietary software. This aligns with HashiCorp's typical licensing strategy for their foundational tools and libraries, promoting ecosystem growth while maintaining reasonable control."
"cloud-consul-ama-api-spec","https://github.com/hashicorp/cloud-consul-ama-api-spec","BUSL","

Reason: Since this repository contains API specifications for HashiCorp Cloud's Consul Amazon Managed Application (AMA), it's likely a core part of HashiCorp's commercial offering. The BUSL license would be appropriate to protect commercial interests while still maintaining some level of openness, as it allows source code access but restricts commercial competition during the initial period."
"cloud-hcs-meta","https://github.com/hashicorp/cloud-hcs-meta","MPL-2.0","

Reason: The 'cloud-hcs-meta' repository appears to be part of HashiCorp's Cloud Services (HCS) ecosystem. Given HashiCorp's typical licensing strategy for cloud-related components and the repository's metadata focus, MPL-2.0 provides the right balance. It ensures code remains open source while requiring modifications to be shared back (file-level copyleft), which aligns with HashiCorp's commitment to open source while maintaining commercial interests in their cloud offerings."
"cluster-api-provider-terraform-cloud","https://github.com/hashicorp/cluster-api-provider-terraform-cloud","MPL-2.0","

Reason: For a Cluster API provider that integrates with Terraform Cloud, the Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0) is most appropriate because it provides a balanced approach for HashiCorp's ecosystem. It ensures source code modifications remain open source while allowing proprietary code to be linked with it, which is ideal for a provider that bridges between open-source Cluster API and HashiCorp's commercial Terraform Cloud service. MPL-2.0 is also HashiCorp's typical choice for their open-source projects, maintaining consistency within their ecosystem."
"colorstring","https://github.com/hashicorp/colorstring","MIT","This repository appears to be a simple utility library for handling colored string outputs, which is a basic functionality that benefits from wide adoption and integration. The MIT license would encourage maximum community engagement and reuse, which is appropriate given the non-core, utility nature of the package. There's minimal commercial differentiation needed for such a basic string formatting tool."
"composite-action-framework-go","https://github.com/hashicorp/composite-action-framework-go","MIT","This repository appears to be a utility framework for GitHub composite actions in Go, which is a developer tooling component. Given its nature as an infrastructure/framework component that benefits from wide adoption and community contributions, and doesn't appear to contain core business differentiators, an MIT license would encourage maximum adoption and community engagement while maintaining simple terms for users."
"consul","https://github.com/hashicorp/consul","MPL-2.0","

Reason: For Consul, MPL-2.0 is most appropriate because it balances community engagement with commercial interests. HashiCorp traditionally uses MPL-2.0 for their core products, as it requires modifications to existing files to be shared back (protecting core functionality) while allowing proprietary additions and integrations. This maintains a healthy open-source ecosystem while enabling commercial opportunities through enterprise features and support services."
"consul-api-double","https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-api-double","MPL-2.0","
Reason: Being a HashiCorp repo related to Consul, and likely serving as an API testing double, MPL-2.0 aligns with HashiCorp's typical licensing strategy for their core open-source products. MPL-2.0 provides a balance of open-source protection while ensuring modifications to the code remain open, which is important for API-related tooling where community collaboration is valuable but some control over modifications is desired."
"consul-appd-extension","https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-appd-extension","MPL-2.0","

Reason: Since this is a Consul extension integrating with AppDynamics, MPL-2.0 aligns with HashiCorp's standard licensing strategy for Consul and its ecosystem. MPL-2.0 provides file-level copyleft protection while allowing commercial usage, which is appropriate for an extension that bridges HashiCorp's open-source tooling with enterprise monitoring solutions.
