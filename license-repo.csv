"awesome-terraform-enterprise","https://github.com/hashicorp/awesome-terraform-enterprise","MIT","This repository appears to be a community-curated list of Terraform Enterprise resources and examples, which is best served by the most permissive open-source license to encourage maximum sharing and contribution. Since it's an ""awesome list"" type repository, it's primarily focused on aggregating community knowledge rather than containing core commercial IP, making MIT's simplicity and widespread acceptance ideal for this use case."
"aws-cloudformation-resource-schema-sdk-go","https://github.com/hashicorp/aws-cloudformation-resource-schema-sdk-go","MPL-2.0","

Reason: Since this is a SDK for AWS CloudFormation resource schemas in Go, and given it's from HashiCorp (who commonly uses MPL-2.0), the Mozilla Public License 2.0 provides a good balance. It allows broad usage and modification while ensuring modifications to the source files remain open source, which is important for a utility SDK. MPL-2.0's file-level copyleft is appropriate for this type of infrastructure tooling while still allowing commercial integration."
"aws-sdk-go","https://github.com/hashicorp/aws-sdk-go","MIT","Since aws-sdk-go is a widely used SDK for AWS integration, using MIT license maximizes community adoption and contribution while allowing commercial use without restrictions. The permissive nature of MIT aligns with the goal of broad AWS ecosystem integration and is consistent with many other AWS-related tools and SDKs."
"aws-sdk-go-base","https://github.com/hashicorp/aws-sdk-go-base","MPL-2.0","

This aligns with HashiCorp's typical licensing strategy for their open-source infrastructure tools and libraries, protecting core components while enabling broad community adoption and contribution."
"aws-service-catalog-engine-for-tfc","https://github.com/hashicorp/aws-service-catalog-engine-for-tfc","MPL-2.0","

Reason: Since this repository integrates AWS Service Catalog with Terraform Cloud, using MPL-2.0 provides a good balance between openness and commercial protection. MPL-2.0's file-level copyleft ensures core modifications remain open while allowing proprietary components to be combined with it. This aligns with HashiCorp's typical licensing strategy for integration tools while maintaining commercial Terraform Cloud differentiation."
"awspolicyequivalence","https://github.com/hashicorp/awspolicyequivalence","MPL-2.0","

Reason: Given that 'awspolicyequivalence' is a tool for AWS policy comparison functionality and based on HashiCorp's repository, MPL-2.0 provides a balanced approach. It ensures source code modifications remain open while allowing the library to be linked with proprietary software. This promotes community engagement through code transparency while maintaining reasonable commercial protections, which aligns with HashiCorp's typical licensing strategy for their open-source tools."
"azure-consul","https://github.com/hashicorp/azure-consul","MPL-2.0","
Reason: Since this is a HashiCorp repository interfacing with Azure for Consul, MPL-2.0 aligns with HashiCorp's typical licensing strategy for their open-source products. MPL-2.0 provides a good balance between openness and commercial protection, allowing for broad community engagement while maintaining file-level copyleft that protects core business value. As an integration tool, it benefits from community contributions while keeping consistent with Consul's main licensing approach."
"azure-sdk-for-go","https://github.com/hashicorp/azure-sdk-for-go","MPL-2.0","

Reason: For the Azure SDK for Go, MPL-2.0 is most appropriate because it provides file-level copyleft protection while allowing commercial use and integration with proprietary software. Given this is an SDK for Azure services, it needs to be business-friendly while ensuring modifications to the core SDK files remain open source. MPL-2.0 strikes the right balance between protecting the community's contributions and allowing commercial adoption."
"backport-dummy","https://github.com/hashicorp/backport-dummy","MPL-2.0","

Reason: Given that this is a ""backport-dummy"" repository and appears to be a HashiCorp project (based on the GitHub URL), MPL-2.0 would be most appropriate. HashiCorp commonly uses MPL-2.0 for their open-source projects as it provides a balance between openness and commercial protection. It allows for free use and modification while ensuring modifications to the original files remain open source, which is suitable for a utility/tool repository like this."
"boundary","https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary","MPL-2.0","

Reason: For Boundary, MPL-2.0 is most appropriate as it balances open source collaboration with HashiCorp's commercial interests. The MPL-2.0 license provides file-level copyleft protection while allowing the code to be used in larger proprietary software, which aligns with HashiCorp's other products (like Vault and Terraform) that use the same license. This maintains consistency in HashiCorp's licensing strategy while encouraging community contributions and protecting core business value."
"boundary-guides","https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-guides","MPL-2.0","

"boundary-plugin-aws","https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-plugin-aws","MPL-2.0","

Reason: As a plugin for HashiCorp Boundary, which itself uses MPL-2.0, maintaining license consistency within the ecosystem is important. MPL-2.0 provides a balance between open-source collaboration and commercial interests, allowing file-level copyleft while permitting linking with code under different licenses. Since this is an AWS integration plugin, MPL-2.0 ensures community can contribute while protecting HashiCorp's commercial interests in the broader Boundary ecosystem."
"boundary-plugin-azure","https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-plugin-azure","MPL-2.0","

Reason: Since this is a plugin for HashiCorp Boundary, it aligns with HashiCorp's existing licensing strategy for their open-source products. The MPL-2.0 license provides a balanced approach that ensures source code modifications remain open while allowing commercial use and integration.
